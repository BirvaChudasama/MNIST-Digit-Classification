# Applied Machine Learning Assignment 1

## 📚 Overview
This notebook implements a neural network model to classify handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. It covers all essential steps including preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## 📁 Files
- `appliedMLassignment1.ipynb`: The main notebook containing code, comments, and result outputs.
- `README.md`: Instructions on how to use the notebook in Google Colab.

## 📌 How to Run the Notebook

1. Open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
2. Upload the notebook:
   - Click **File > Upload Notebook**
   - Select `appliedMLassignment1.ipynb`
3. Click **Runtime > Run all** to execute the entire notebook.

> 💡 Ensure your runtime is set to **Python 3 + GPU** (if training time needs optimization):  
`Runtime > Change runtime type > Hardware Accelerator > GPU`
